# PHP Unexpected Variable Type Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to variable type handling within conditional statements.  Loose typing, while offering flexibility, can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed.

The `bug.php` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version.  The problem arises from implicit type coercion within the conditional statements and how PHP handles variable assignments within conditional blocks.  The solution involves explicit type checking or careful variable initialization to prevent such issues.
